1. 'git init' -> powers yourfolder to managed by git, and initialise the empty git repository.
              It also contain .git file which hold all the relevent logics to maintain the 
              versions of your project

2. 'Working arra' -> There can be bunch of files that are not currently handled by the git.
                     It states that the change done or to be done in those files are not managed by the git yet.
                     A file which is in working area is not considered in staged area.
                     untracked files are in working area only

3. 'Staging Area' -> what all files are going to be part of the next version we will create.
                     this staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version 
                     to this version
